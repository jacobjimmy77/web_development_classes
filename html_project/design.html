                                One major influence on how viewers percive a product is it design. Design theory is a collection 
                                of principles that professionals use to create effective design. If you are interested in a career
                                in design or completing a design project, understanding these principles may help you determine 
                                which visual element best represent the purpose of the finished product. In this article, we define
                                what design theory is, discuss it's importance in graphics design, list the different types of design 
                                principles and provide tips to guide your work.

                             Design theory is a research field concerned with the theoretical approaches that help artist understand 
                            basic design principles and best practices. Graphic designers often apply this theories when creating 
                            images for marketing purposes, such as market campaigns or brand management. It helps artist understand 
                            how to effectively convey a massage to an audience through visual cues. This theory may help designers 
                            learn how aesthetic principles impact a viewer's interpretation of a design product.

                             Design theory can help both companies and designers create visually apealing and practical product. Its
                             principles can help creators describe the problem and use design features to create human-centered solutions.

                        the artist communicate a clear and meaningful massage to the audience. Here are some design principles that an artist
                        can apply:

                            <h3>Balance:</h3> 
                            The distribution of visual weight in a design. It can be symmetrical (mirrored), asymmetrical (balanced 
                            through contrast), or radial (around a center point).

                            <h3>Contrast:</h3>
                            The juxtaposition of opposing elements (e.g., light vs. dark, large vs. small) to create visual 
                            interest and direct attention.<br>

                            Highlighting a specific area or object to make it the most prominent part of the design.

                        <div>

                            Organizing elements in order of importance so the viewer knows where to look first, second, and third.
                            Repetition: Using the same colors, fonts, or shapes throughout a piece to create consistency and strengthen brand 
                            identity.

                    <h1>Alignment</h1> 
                    <p> 
                        Aligment refers to arrangement of text and graphics design element on a page to create a coherent visual pattern.
                        Graphics designers usually use alignment to ensure that their visual convey the desired message to the viewers.
                        Example of alignment has been illustated above
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Alignment is the design principle of arranging elements along invisible lines or within a grid system to create 
                        order, connection, and a professional look. It ensures that nothing is placed arbitrarily, allowing the viewer's 
                        eye to follow a structured path. 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Edge Alignment:</li>
                            Lining up elements by their outer edges (left, right, top, or bottom).
                            <em style="color: green;">Left (Flush Left);</em> The most common for body text in Western cultures as it mirrors natural reading patterns.
                            <em style="color: green;">Right (Flush Right);</em> Often used for captions or in right-to-left languages (e.g., Arabic); it can feel modern or 
                            "offbeat". 
                        <li>Center Alignment:</li> 
                            Positioning elements along a central horizontal or vertical axis. It creates a formal, 
                            symmetrical look but can make long paragraphs harder to read due to "ragged" edges on both sides.
                        <li>Justified Alignment:</li> 
                            Stretching text to align with both left and right margins. Commonly used in newspapers and magazines
                            to create clean blocks of information.
                        <li>Optical Alignment:</li> 
                            Adjusting elements based on human perception rather than strict mathematical centering. For example, 
                            a circle might need to be "nudged" slightly to look centered next to a square.
